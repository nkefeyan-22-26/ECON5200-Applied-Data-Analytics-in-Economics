# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my repository for **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**. This portfolio represents my journey in bridging traditional economic theory with modern data science methodologies.

## About This Portfolio

As an undergraduate economics student, I'm developing expertise at the intersection of causal inference and predictive analytics. This repository showcases my work in scaling foundational statistical concepts using machine learning techniques—what I call the "Concept Extension" approach.

Here, you'll find coursework and lab projects where I take classical methods like regression analysis and extend them into the realm of modern ML algorithms such as Lasso, Ridge, and ensemble methods. My goal is to demonstrate how economists can leverage computational tools to extract deeper insights from complex datasets while maintaining rigorous analytical standards.

I'm currently seeking opportunities in **Economic Consulting** where I can apply these skills to real-world policy and business challenges.

## Tech Stack

## Course Philosophy: Concept Extension

The framework guiding this work:
1. **Foundation**: Master traditional econometric and statistical methods
2. **Extension**: Scale these concepts using machine learning algorithms
3. **Application**: Apply both approaches to solve real economic problems

This approach ensures I maintain the theoretical rigor of economics while harnessing the predictive power of modern data science.
